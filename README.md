# Spellbook
Personal DND Spellbook project

If you have ever played as a wizard in a DND 3.5 Campaign, you know how annoying it is to keep track of your spells. Which ones you know, what they do, which ones and how many you have prepared. It's a hassle, and requires a lot of erasing and page flipping. I got very annoyed at all of this and decided to start this project. The goal is to have a java program that I can use to essentially be my spellbook. There should be a database of spells that you can add to, so it can store what the spells do. From that list, you can add spells to your spellbook, designated as known spells. From those you can add spells to your prepared list, and check them off as you use them/refresh and replace them as you take rests.
